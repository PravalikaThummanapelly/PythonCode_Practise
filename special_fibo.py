'''Problem Statement: 
Alex is exploring a series and she came across a special series,
 in which f(N)=f(N-1)*f(N-1)+(N-2)*(N-2) mod 47 
 where f(0) = 1. f(1)=1 
 Your task is to help Alex find and return an integer value, 
 representing the Nth  number in this special series. 
   Sample Input: 4 
   Sample Output: 29'''
